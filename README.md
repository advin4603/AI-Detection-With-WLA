# SemEval-2024 Task 8: Weighted Layer Averaging RoBERTa for Black-Box Machine-Generated Text Detection

This repository contains code and resources for the system submitted to SemEval-2024 Task 8: Weighted Layer Averaging RoBERTa for Black-Box Machine-Generated Text Detection.

## Abstract

This document contains the details of the authors' submission to the proceedings of SemEval 2024's Task 8: Multigenerator, Multidomain, and Multilingual Black-Box Machine-Generated Text Detection Subtask A (monolingual) and B. Detection of machine-generated text is becoming an increasingly important task, with the advent of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we lay out how using weighted averages of RoBERTa layers lets us capture information about text that is relevant to machine-generated text detection.
